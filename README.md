# ManageCraft
A Minecraft server manager/wrapper. A desktop application that let's you manage &amp; configure your remote Minecraft server.

Adding an appropriately decorative, intuitive, easy to use interface for Minecraft server administrators to manage their servers remotely.
No need to get down in the weeds of connecting to your server via terminal/console/cli (command line interface).
And if your server is locally on your PC Desktop, no problem! We have compatibility for that too! But why not just use the default minecraft server console?
ManageCraft comes with buttons and visuals that allow you to easily configure your server properties (settings), add & remove mods, and even view your server's status & performance.
The app also comes with your generic start/stop/restart buttons like in any *Minecraft Server Hosting Service*. And of course the console as well to send commands while the server is running.

We plan on adding more features like scheduling commands and restarts.
